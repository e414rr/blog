		<h3 style="background-color:yellow;">A narrator may be close to, or even part
		of, the action in a work of fiction, or
		distant in time and/or space. What is the
		effect of either the closeness or the
		distance of narrators?</h3>
		<p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"><b>The narrator telling a story can make a story sound how they want to make it sound. They set the tone for the whole book. Their choice of language is impactful and can foreshadow events in a fiction book. Especially in works from the Gothic and Romantic era. Narrators can also be fully or limited omniscient and tell the reader everything a chracter is feeling.</b></p>
